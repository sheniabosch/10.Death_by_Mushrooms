# 10.Death_by_Mushrooms
ML Case Study – Mushroom Classification (Completed)

Objective: Built a classifier to distinguish edible from poisonous mushrooms using real-world fungal features from the UCI dataset.
Project Goal: Achieved 100 % accuracy on the test set by modeling 22 categorical and numerical traits (cap shape, odor, gill color, etc.)—because nobody should learn the hard way.
Key Achievements:
Preprocessed 8,000+ mushroom records: encoded categoricals, handled missing values (looking at you, stalk-root).
Compared Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost; tuned hyperparameters with cross-validation.
Interpreted feature importance—odor alone separated safe from deadly 97 % of the time.

Focus: End-to-end supervised learning on imbalanced, real-life data—proving simple models can save lives (or at least dinner).

Steps Completed:
🍄 Loaded and Explored the UCI Mushroom Dataset
🔍 Cleaned and Encoded Categorical Features
🌳 Trained Decision Tree and Ensemble Models
⚡ Evaluated with Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC
🎯 Performed Hyperparameter Tuning
📜 Generated SHAP Explanations for Transparency
